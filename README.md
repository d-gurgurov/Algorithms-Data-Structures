| Arrays        | Two Sum               |               | use hash map to instantly check for difference value, map will add index of last occurrence of a num, donâ€™t use same element twice;  |  |
| Linked Lists  | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock   |   | find local min and search for local max, sliding window;               |  |
| Trees         | Contains Duplicate    |               | hashset to get unique values in array, to check for duplicates easily |  |
| Sorting       | Maximum Subarray      |               | pattern: prev subarray cant be negative, dynamic programming: compute max sum for each prefix           |  |
